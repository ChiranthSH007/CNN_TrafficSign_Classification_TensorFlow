# TrafficSign Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (TensorFlow)

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Aim of the project

The aim of the project is the implementation of a picture classification model for traffic signs. It's simultaneously necessary for the model to be accurate and fast in detection.
The model is built using TensorFlow based on Convolutional Neural Networks which predicts the type of traffic sign in realtime.


## Requirments

To deploy this project all the below package are required

```bash
keras
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow-gpu==2.9.0
opencv-python
scikit-learn
```
